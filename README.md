# FastAPI_Basic_App
üìù Basic application of important FastAPI concepts, such assecurity, user models, path &amp; query parameters, HTTP methods etc., following the standard design model.

‚úÖ This project allows me the space and freedom to test and learn FastAPI on my own terms. The files within the project represent the concepts I have pursued and understood.

‚û°Ô∏è''main'' file is mainly used for HTTP methods and response models.

‚û°Ô∏è''security'' file is used for authorization & authentification, token coding and decoding.

‚û°Ô∏è''models'' file is used for providing user models to the main file.

‚û°Ô∏è''test'' file is used for testing the proper functionality of the app

‚û°Ô∏è''databases'' file served as a template for working with sql databases, but I discovered it was mainly outdated and so left it there for future reference
