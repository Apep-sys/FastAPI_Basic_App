# FastAPI_Basic_App
✅ Basic application of important FastAPI concepts, such assecurity, user models, path &amp; query parameters, HTTP methods etc., following the standard design model.

✅ This project allows me the space and freedom to test and learn FastAPI on my own terms. The files within the project represent the concepts I have pursued and understood.

➡️''main'' file is mainly used for HTTP methods and response models.

➡️''security'' file is used for authorization & authentification, token coding and decoding.

➡️''models'' file is used for providing user models to the main file.

➡️''test'' file is used for testing the proper functionality of the app

➡️''databases'' file served as a template for working with sql databases, but I discovered it was mainly outdated and so left it there for future reference
